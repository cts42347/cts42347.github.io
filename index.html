                <p>Hi! My name is Conor Smith and I am a student at The University of Georgia. I expect to graduate in December of 2018 with a degree in Communication Studies. </p>
                
                <p>Photography is a hobby of mine. (As you can probably tell from the lackluster quality of some of these pictures) I am mostly into nature and wildlife photography! <b>To see my photography portfolio, check out the menu to the left. </b></p>
                
                <p>If you wish to see more of my photography visit my Instagram page by clicking on the bullet point under Photography!

                <hr style="border-color:#070505">
                
                <p>My dream would be to travel much more of the world and use photography to create specific memories and capture them, so they will last me a lifetime! Photography helps to immerse people in nature, as well as in the cultures of the places we visit.
